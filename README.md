# OCR - Handwritten digit recognition

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology interprets images to extract textual information.

This project aims to apply OCR technology by creating neural network classifiers specialized in identifying handwritten digits (0-9) drawn by a user in an interface.

The project was developed in Matlab using the Deep Learning Toolbox.
